# EndlessRunnerProject
Endless Runner in Unity
An Endless Runner project coded by me and art by Lump Wizard. This was my first time working with custom art assests so there was some time spent researching. This project will be ongoing while I await more art assets and work on other games.

Creating this game also taught me more about creating parallax effects, spawn mangement, timers, respawn cycles, and a scoring system. ![early_concept](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19357608/171794023-d50d97c6-3ee0-4cf8-a86a-5f2b2ccc1569.png)
